   # Quantum A* Search Algorithm

   ## Overview
   This repository contains a **Quantum A* search algorithm** implementation combining **Q#** for quantum optimization and **Kotlin** for classical graph handling. The algorithm uses quantum search techniques like **Grover's Algorithm** and **Amplitude Amplification** to accelerate the pathfinding process.

   ## Features
   - Quantum-enhanced pathfinding using Grover's algorithm for optimal path amplification.
   - Classical integration via **Kotlin** for managing graph traversal and heuristic evaluation.
   - Interfaces with **Azure Quantum** to run Q# operations on quantum processors.
   
   ## Files
   - `QuantumAStar.kt`: Kotlin code for managing the graph and integrating with Azure Quantum.
   - `QuantumAStar.qs`: Q# code for performing quantum A* search and Grover’s algorithm.
   - `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions.

   ## Setup Instructions

   ### Prerequisites
   - **Azure Quantum** account for accessing quantum computing resources.
   - **Java** and **Kotlin** installed to run the Kotlin code.
   - **Q#** and **Azure Quantum SDK** for interacting with quantum resources.

   ### Running the Project
   1. Clone the repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/stpaul2coderdojo/Quantum-Code-Units.git
      ```
   2. Navigate to the project directory:
      ```bash
      cd Quantum-Code-Units
      ```
   3. Run the Kotlin application to invoke the quantum search:
      ```bash
      // Your preferred Kotlin command or IDE
      kotlin QuantumAStar.kt
      ```

   ### How it Works
   The classical Kotlin code initializes a graph, sets a start and goal node, and submits the job to Azure Quantum. The quantum component (written in Q#) performs a Grover’s search on the graph, amplifying the optimal path.
